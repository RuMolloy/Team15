# Team15
Android app to allow GAA teams (gaelic football and hurling) to publish their starting 15 players for any given game along with fixture info to their social media accounts.

1. Inspiration from similar apps for other sports, websites, tv shows, social media etc. collated [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/FH3SJMFPAC5/) by creating a 'board' on [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), then used the 'freehand' tool to create some low fidelity mock-ups [here](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/NQsES8All)

2. [Figma](https://www.figma.com) used to create higher fidelity mock-ups [here](https://www.figma.com/file/UVTI2edjZDEThpWotpd9LRFP/Team15?node-id=150%3A5414) with a [clickable prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/UVTI2edjZDEThpWotpd9LRFP/Team15?node-id=151%3A5545&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=150%3A5414&starting-point-node-id=151%3A5545&show-proto-sidebar=1)
